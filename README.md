# 🌿 Nature’s Veil — E-Commerce Demo

A front-end eCommerce demo built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with full client-side logic powered by `localStorage`.  
This project showcases a complete shopping experience — from browsing to checkout — all without a backend.

## 💾 How It Works
- All user data (cart, users, reviews, orders) is stored locally using `localStorage`.
- Checkout “places” fake orders and displays them in the logged-in user’s account.
- No backend — everything runs client-side, ideal for portfolio demos.
